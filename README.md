# TrivagoDiscoverDemo
Automation Suite for testing Trivago Discover Feature Demo

# Task 3 â€“ Test Case Automation

Gherkin(BDD) notation has been used along with Robot Framework & SeleniumLibrary. Page Object Model has been implemented to separte test script file, setup file from the resource and keywords file. Result folder contains report, log & output files. I've captured Screen shot of the Actual results which are also saved under Results folder.

Test Suite has 3 folders:

Tests - It has driving script, it has steps in the form of Gherkin notation(Trivago_Discover.robot).

Resources - It has scripts for Setup & Teardwon(Opening & closing browsers), it also has scripts that are user defined Keywords and various page files in POM structure(PO- All the test steps are defined in different files under this sub folder)

Results - Report & Log files in html(can be opened in a browser), output file in XML format.
